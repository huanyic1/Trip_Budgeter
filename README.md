Travel to a new place but don't know how much to expect to pay? 
Worry no more with our new Trip-Budgeter! Simply input your destination (currently supporting New York and Boston) and how long you are staying for, and we will output your expected costs! Not only will your planning be easier, you'll know exactly if you are getting a great deal or not. 

Furthermore, we are always looking to improve. With our Help Us Improve tab, you can input your costs after taking a trip, and we will update our data to reflect it!

For future development, we hope that this data collection feature will be more robust, automatically collecting it from user's bank statements (with permission of course), to provide even more accurate predictions.
